## Introduction

My name is Jacob Nyrup. I am an Associate Professor at University of Oslo. I hold a DPhil in Politics from Nuffield College, University of Oxford, where I am also an Associate Member. Furthermore, I am affiliated with the projects [ELDAR](https://www.sv.uio.no/isv/english/research/projects/ELDAR/) and [WEALTHPOL](https://wealthpol.web.ox.ac.uk/home).

My research has been published or is forthcoming in _the American Political Science Review_, _the Journal of Politics_, _World Politics_, _European Journal of Political Research_, and other journals. I mostly work within comparative politics and political economy. My CV can be found [here](http://bit.ly/2Ohuxqm).

#### Bio and research interests

My research focuses on three separate areas, namely `authoritarian regimes`, `wealth inequality`, and `Danish municipalities`. To most people these three topics seem incompatible and weirdly unrelated. Nonetheless, my choice of research is not the result of a completely random walk.

<br>

I did my first master's degree at London School of Economics, where I studied statistics and political economy. Here, I wrote my thesis on coalition formation in Danish Municipalities. This may sound dull to most people, but it actually concerns a fairly important issue; how is power distributed following an election? Furthermore, it opened up my eyes to the ocean of data, which is available on elections in Danish municipalities. My research on `Danish municipalities` includes the paper [Confident and cautious candidates: Explaining under-representation of women in Danish municipal politics](https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6765.12396) (With Malte Dahl), and another article on the [inclusion of extreme parties in local government](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/732962) witten with Martin Vinæs Larsen and Frederik Hjorth is forthcoming in _the Journal of Politics_. As part of this project we have build the most comprehensive [database](https://osf.io/9sc7r/?view_only=) on local elections in Denmark.

<br>

After finishing my first master's degree, I went on to do another at University of Copenhagen. Here, I took courses in development economics and comparative regime types. I found that, while there is a big body on literature on institutions in democracies, the literature on authoritarian regimes is lacking. Therefore, I decided to apply for a Ph.D., focusing on authoritarian regimes. My research on `authoritarian regimes` includes the papers [Performance and Promotions in an Autocracy](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cuny/cp/pre-prints/content-jcpo_54106) (with Lasse Aaskoven) and [The Morning After: Cabinet Instability and the Purging of Ministers after Failed Coup Attempts in Autocracies](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/716952) (with Laure Bokobza, Suthan Krishnarajan, Casper Sakstrup, and Lasse Aaskoven). I am working on a handful of papers based on my PhD. Furthermore, the project [WhoGov](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/our-research/research-centres/nuffield-politics-research-centre/whogov/) emanates from my Ph.D. WhoGov is the largest available dataset on members of government across time and countries, and is presented in the article [Who Governs? A New Global Dataset on Members of Cabinets](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/who-governs-a-new-global-dataset-on-members-of-cabinets/3AE11258F668EB95F5A9F6904EF80A45). WhoGov won the Lijphart/Przeworski/Verba Best Data Set Award 2021.

I began my Ph.D. at Oxford in October 2016. I had Ben Ansell as my supervisor. Here, I got affiliated with the [WEALTHPOL](https://wealthpol.web.ox.ac.uk/home)-project, and I therefore also work on `wealth inequality`. As a part of the project I have, amongst other things, co-authored the paper [Sheltering Populists? House Prices and the Support for Populist Parties](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/718354) (With Ben Ansell, Martin Vinæs Larsen and Frederik Hjorth). This article won the _APSA European Politics and Society section Best Article Award 2022_.
