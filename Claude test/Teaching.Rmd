### Teaching experience

I enjoy advising students writing their Master's Theses. I prefer advising students on topics related to authoritarian politics, political economy, or wealth inequality. Furthermore, I am far stronger in advising students working with quantitative methods than qualitative methods. If you are a student at University of Oslo considering working with me, then please reach out.
